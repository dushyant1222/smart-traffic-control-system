## 🔍 Overview

This project dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on the **real-time number of vehicles** detected using **YOLOv8**. It helps to:

- ✅ Reduce CO₂ emissions by up to **35,000 tons/year** for 10 lakh vehicles
- ✅ Save thousands of liters of fuel at traffic junctions
- ✅ Enable fair and efficient green light allocation across **4 signal directions**
- ✅ Support government smart city infrastructure initiatives
